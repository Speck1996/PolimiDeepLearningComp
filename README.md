# Kaggle competitions' notebooks related to the course Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (2018/2019)

The three notebooks are related to the following challenges:
* The ClassificationChallenge is the notebook created for the image classification challenge. The network is built upon a fine tuned Xception
* The SegmentationChallenge is the notebook created for the image segmentation challenge. The network is a ResU-Net with a pretrained encoder.
* The VQAChallenge is the notebook created for the visual question answering challenge. The network uses a pretrained vgg for the image part and an embedding layer followed by a LSTM for the language part.
